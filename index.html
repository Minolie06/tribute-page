			<h2>About the Author</h2>
			<section id="bio">
				<div>
					<p>
						Ursula K Le Guin was born in 1929 in Berkeley, California 
						to an artistically and intellectually vibrant home.
						She struggled initially to be published in the mainstream fiction world, 
						but her first three novels, Rocannon's World, Planet of Exile and City of Illusions, 
						put her on the sci-fi map.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2008, 40 years later, Le Guin made literary news with Lavinia, 
						a metatextual examination of a minor character from Virgil's Aeneid. 
						Le Guin was also widely known for her globally popular Earthsea fantasy series. 
						She wrote essays on fantasy fiction and feminist issues as well, 
						and was awarded the Living Legend Medal by the Library of Congress, 
						among a plethora of career honors. 
						Le Guin died at her home in Portland, Oregon, on January 22, 2018, at age 88.

						<p>
							A writer is a person who cares what words mean, what they say, how they say it. 
							Writers know words are their way towards truth and freedom, 
							and so they use them with care, with thought, with fear, with delight. 
							By using words well they strengthen their souls. 
							Story-tellers and poets spend their lives learning that skill and art of using words well. 
							And their words make the souls of their readers stronger, brighter, deeper.
